# Personal Workflow
* Editor = [Neovim](https://neovim.io)
    * I have two configurations , one primarly set up for competitive programming , and the other one for general purpose programming. 
    * The former has no plugins and is meant to be a minimal setup designed to be used in time sensitive environments, whereas the latter has a surplus of plugins to my taste.
